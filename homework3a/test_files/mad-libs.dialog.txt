``Once upon a time a student at found themselves in a math class.
The teacher was so angry that the student started to daydream about a cat.
Then the student woke up and realized that they were still in class.
The teacher was so annoyed that they gave the student a 33 on the assignment.
The student was so smelly that he ran the class and went home to play Minecraft.
The moral of the story is that you should never sprint in class.
