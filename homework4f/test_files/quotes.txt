In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life:| it goes on.| - Robert Frost
Life is infinitely stranger than anything which| the mind of man could invent.| - Arthur Conan Doyle
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.| - John Lennon
Life is pure adventure, and the sooner we realize that,| the quicker we will be able to treat life as art.| - Maya Angelou
